# polygons.js

A small but useful barebones javascript library used for rendering polygons and doing other polygon maths

The library currently includes these features:
<ul>
<li>2d vectors</li>
<li>2d polygon structures</li>
<li>rendering 2d polygons</li>
<li>raycasting intersections with polygons</li>
<li>polygon collision overlap detection</li>
<li>polygon axis aligned bounding boxes</li>
</ul>
 
I plan on adding these features to the library eventually:
<ul>
<li>polygon boolean operations</li>
</ul>
