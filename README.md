# polygons.js
v0.8.0

documentation/examples:
http://docs.technostalgic.tech/libs/polygons.js/v0.8.0/index.html

A small but useful barebones javascript library used for rendering polygons and doing other polygon maths

The library currently includes these features:
<ul>
<li>2d vectors</li>
<li>2d polygon structures</li>
<li>rendering 2d polygons</li>
<li>raycasting intersections with polygons</li>
<li>polygon collision overlap detection</li>
<li>axis aligned bounding boxes with efficient raycast collision detection</li>
</ul>
 
I plan on adding these features to the library eventually:
<ul>
<li>polygon boolean operations</li>
</ul>
